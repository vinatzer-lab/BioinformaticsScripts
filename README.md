### Discrete scripts for input/output processing and manipulation  
`download_WGS_from_NCBI.py` allows downloading WGS from NCBI, given a list of accession numbers.
Currently taking SRA WGS accession.  
`find_synonymous.py` helps to identify synonymous and non-synonymous changes 
based on VCF file and genome annotation file, where they use the same 
gene IDs.  
`fetch_representative.py` is used to find the representative genomes of 
LINgroups of a selected length (or degree of similarity) which belong to a 
given LINgroup.
